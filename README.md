## ABOUT

A PowerShell script that sets up a React Native Android development environment by starting processes and repositions the windows on the screen.
	
## HOW IT WORKS

The script starts an Android Emulator and moves its to a specified location on the screen.
Then, the PowerShell terminal windows are created and relocated as well.
Finally, the script starts your favorite IDE.
